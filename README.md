# Portfolio

A project created as an example of a developer's portfolio

## Description

This project's goal was to create a portfolio that a web developer would have. The web page shows information about the person, projects made by the developer, and contact information. The page makes use of links that direct to a resume, application, and ways to contact the developer. All the links used link to Google searches or Wikipedia pages about the subject, not to actual applications. 

During the creation of this application, flexbox was used to design the layout of the page, pseudoclasses were used for the header, footer, and links to add styles when hovering, and the application was made to be responsive to screen size using a media tag, increasing understanding of the respective topics.
